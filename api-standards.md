## Guidelines

This document provides guidelines and examples for White House Web APIs, encouraging consistency, maintainability, and best practices across applications. White House APIs aim to balance a truly RESTful API interface with a positive developer experience (DX).

This document borrows heavily from:
* [Designing HTTP Interfaces and RESTful Web Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEyg0TnieLg)
* [API Facade Pattern](http://apigee.com/about/content/api-fa%C3%A7ade-pattern), by Brian Mulloy, Apigee
* [Web API Design](http://pages.apigee.com/web-api-design-ebook.html), by Brian Mulloy, Apigee
* [Fielding's Dissertation on REST](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)

## Pragmatic REST

These guidelines aim to support a truly RESTful API. Here are a few exceptions:
* Put the version number of the API in the URL (see examples below). Don’t accept any requests that do not specify a version number.
* Allow users to request formats like JSON or XML like this:
    * http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
    * http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.xml

## RESTful URLs

### General guidelines for RESTful URLs
* A URL identifies a resource.
* URLs should include nouns, not verbs.
* Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
* Use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on the collections and elements.
* You shouldn’t need to go deeper than resource/identifier/resource.
* Put the version number at the base of your URL, for example http://example.com/v1/path/to/resource.
* URL v. header:
    * If it changes the logic you write to handle the response, put it in the URL.
    * If it doesn’t change the logic for each response, like OAuth info, put it in the header.
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list.
* Formats should be in the form of api/v2/resource/{id}.json

### Good URL examples
* List of magazines:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
* Filtering is a query:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json?year=2011&sort=desc
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json?topic=economy&year=2011
* A single magazine in JSON format:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234.json
* All articles in (or belonging to) this magazine:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.json
* All articles in this magazine in XML format:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.xml
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234.json?fields=title,subtitle,date
* Add a new article to a particular magazine:
    * POST http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles

### Bad URL examples
* Non-plural noun:
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine/1234
    * http://www.example.gov/publisher/magazine/1234
* Verb in URL:
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine/1234/create
* Filter outside of query string
    * http://www.example.gov/magazines/2011/desc

## HTTP Verbs

HTTP verbs, or methods, should be used in compliance with their definitions under the [HTTP/1.1](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) standard.
The action taken on the representation will be contextual to the media type being worked on and its current state. Here's an example of how HTTP verbs map to create, read, update, delete operations in a particular context:

| HTTP METHOD | POST            | GET       | PUT         | DELETE |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| CRUD OP     | CREATE          | READ      | UPDATE      | DELETE |
| /dogs       | Create new dogs | List dogs | Bulk update | Delete all dogs |
| /dogs/1234  | Error           | Show Bo   | If exists, update Bo; If not, error | Delete Bo |

(Example from Web API Design, by Brian Mulloy, Apigee.)


## Responses

* No values in keys
* No internal-specific names (e.g. "node" and "taxonomy term")
* Metadata should only contain direct properties of the response set, not properties of the members of the response set

### Good examples

No values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"id": "125", "name": "Environment"},
      {"id": "834", "name": "Water Quality"}
    ],


### Bad examples

Values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"125": "Environment"},
      {"834": "Water Quality"}
    ],


## Error handling

Error responses should include a common HTTP status code, message for the developer, message for the end-user (when appropriate), internal error code (corresponding to some specific internally determined ID), links where developers can find more info. For example:

    {
      "status" : 400,
      "developerMessage" : "Verbose, plain language description of the problem. Provide developers
       suggestions about how to solve their problems here",
      "userMessage" : "This is a message that can be passed along to end-users, if needed.",
      "errorCode" : "444444",
      "moreInfo" : "http://www.example.gov/developer/path/to/help/for/444444,
       http://drupal.org/node/444444",
    }

Use three simple, common response codes indicating (1) success, (2) failure due to client-side problem, (3) failure due to server-side problem:
* 200 - OK
* 400 - Bad Request
* 500 - Internal Server Error


## Versions

* Never release an API without a version number.
* Versions should be integers, not decimal numbers, prefixed with ‘v’. For example:
    * Good: v1, v2, v3
    * Bad: v-1.1, v1.2, 1.3
* Maintain APIs at least one version back.


## Record limits

* If no limit is specified, return results with a default limit.
* To get records 51 through 75 do this:
    * http://example.gov/magazines?limit=25&offset=50
    * offset=50 means, ‘skip the first 50 records’
    * limit=25 means, ‘return a maximum of 25 records’

Information about record limits and total available count should also be included in the response. Example:

    {
        "metadata": {
            "resultset": {
                "count": 227,
                "offset": 25,
                "limit": 25
            }
        },
        "results": []
    }

## Request & Response Examples

                ],
                "created": "126251302"
            }
            {
                "id": 2351,
                "type": "magazine",
                "title": "Public Schools",

                ],
                "created": "126251302"
            }
        ]
    }

### GET /magazines/[id]

Example: http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/[id].json

Response body:

    {
        "id": "1234",
        "type": "magazine",
        "title": "Public Water Systems",
        "tags": [
            {"id": "125", "name": "Environment"},
            {"id": "834", "name": "Water Quality"}
        ],
        "created": "1231621302"
    }



### POST /magazines/[id]/articles

Example: Create – POST  http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/[id]/articles

Request body:

    [
        {
            "title": "Raising Revenue",
            "author_first_name": "Jane",
            "author_last_name": "Smith",
            "author_email": "jane.smith@example.gov",
            "year": "2012",
            "month": "August",
            "day": "18",
            "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam eget ante ut augue scelerisque ornare. Aliquam tempus rhoncus quam vel luctus. Sed scelerisque fermentum fringilla. Suspendisse tincidunt nisl a metus feugiat vitae vestibulum enim vulputate. Quisque vehicula dictum elit, vitae cursus libero auctor sed. Vestibulum fermentum elementum nunc. Proin aliquam erat in turpis vehicula sit amet tristique lorem blandit. Nam augue est, bibendum et ultrices non, interdum in est. Quisque gravida orci lobortis... "
        }
    ]


## Mock Responses
It is suggested that each resource accept a 'mock' parameter on the testing server. Passing this parameter should return a mock data response (bypassing the backend).

Implementing this feature early in development ensures that the API will exhibit consistent behavior, supporting a test driven development methodology.

Note: If the mock parameter is included in a request to the production environment, an error should be raised.


## JSONP

JSONP is easiest explained with an example. Here's one from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/what-is-jsonp-all-about?answertab=votes#tab-top):

> Say you're on domain abc.com, and you want to make a request to domain xyz.com. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland.

> The one item that bypasses this limitation is `<script>` tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really DO anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated.

> Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle.

> For example, say the server expects a parameter called "callback" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like:

>         http://www.xyz.com/sample.aspx?callback=mycallback

> Without JSONP, this might return some basic javascript object, like so:

>         { foo: 'bar' }

> However, with JSONP, when the server receives the "callback" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this:

>         mycallback({ foo: 'bar' });

> As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function:

>         mycallback = function(data){
>             alert(data.foo);
>         };

# 18F API Standards

This document captures 18F's view of API best practices and standards. We aim to incorporate as many of them as possible into our work.

APIs, like other web applications, vary greatly in implementation and design, depending on the situation and the problem the application is solving.

This document provides a mix of:

* **High level design guidance** that individual APIs interpret to meet their needs.
* **Low level web practices** that most modern HTTP APIs use.

### Design for common use cases

For APIs that syndicate data, consider several common client use cases:

* **Bulk data.** Clients often wish to establish their own copy of the API's dataset in its entirety. For example, someone might like to build their own search engine on top of the dataset, using different parameters and technology than the "official" API allows. If the API can't easily act as a bulk data provider, provide a separate mechanism for acquiring the backing dataset in bulk.
* **Staying up to date.** Especially for large datasets, clients may want to keep their dataset up to date without downloading the data set after every change. If this is a use case for the API, prioritize it in the design.
* **Driving expensive actions.** What would happen if a client wanted to automatically send text messages to thousands of people or light up the side of a skyscraper every time a new record appears? Consider whether the API's records will always be in a reliable unchanging order, and whether they tend to appear in clumps or in a steady stream. Generally speaking, consider the "entropy" an API client would experience.\

### Using one's own API

The #1 best way to understand and address the weaknesses in an API's design and implementation is to use it in a production system.

Whenever feasible, design an API in parallel with an accompanying integration of that API.

### Point of contact

Have an obvious mechanism for clients to report issues and ask questions about the API.

When using GitHub for an API's code, use the associated issue tracker. In addition, publish an email address for direct, non-public inquiries.

### Notifications of updates

Have a simple mechanism for clients to follow changes to the API.

Common ways to do this include a mailing list, or a [dedicated developer blog](https://developer.github.com/changes/) with an RSS feed.

### API Endpoints

An "endpoint" is a combination of two things:

* The verb (e.g. `GET` or `POST`)
* The URL path (e.g. `/posts`)

Information can be passed to an endpoint in either of two ways:

* The URL query string (e.g. `?year=2014`)
* HTTP headers (e.g. `X-Api-Key: my-key`)

When people say "RESTful" nowadays, they really mean designing simple, intuitive endpoints that represent unique functions in the API.

Generally speaking:

* **Avoid single-endpoint APIs.** Don't jam multiple operations into the same endpoint with the same HTTP verb.
* **Prioritize simplicity.** It should be easy to guess what an endpoint does by looking at the URL and HTTP verb, without needing to see a query string.
* Endpoint URLs should advertise resources, and **avoid verbs**.

Some examples of these principles in action:

* [FBOpen API documentation](http://docs.fbopen.apiary.io)
* [OpenFDA example query](http://open.fda.gov/api/reference/#example-query)
* [Sunlight Congress API methods](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/#using-the-api)

### Just use JSON

[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is an excellent, widely supported transport format, suitable for many web APIs.

Supporting JSON and only JSON is a practical default for APIs, and generally reduces complexity for both the API provider and consumer.

General JSON guidelines:

* Responses should be **a JSON object** (not an array). Using an array to return results limits the ability to include metadata about results, and limits the API's ability to add additional top-level keys in the future.
* **Don't use unpredictable keys**. Parsing a JSON response where keys are unpredictable (e.g. derived from data) is difficult, and adds friction for clients.
* **Use `under_score` case for keys**. Different languages use different case conventions. JSON uses `under_score`, not `camelCase`.

### Use a consistent date format

And specifically, [use ISO 8601](https://xkcd.com/1179/), in UTC.

For just dates, that looks like `2013-02-27`. For full times, that's of the form `2013-02-27T10:00:00Z`.

This date format is used all over the web, and puts each field in consistent order -- from least granular to most granular.


### API Keys

These standards do not take a position on whether or not to use API keys.

But _if_ keys are used to manage and authenticate API access, the API should allow some sort of unauthenticated access, without keys.

This allows newcomers to use and experiment with the API in demo environments and with simple `curl`/`wget`/etc. requests.

Consider whether one of your product goals is to allow a certain level of normal production use of the API without enforcing advanced registration by clients.


### Error handling

Handle all errors (including otherwise uncaught exceptions) and return a data structure in the same format as the rest of the API.

For example, a JSON API might provide the following when an uncaught exception occurs:

```json
{
  "status" : 500,
  "message": "Description of the error.",
  "exception": "[detailed stacktrace]"
}
```

HTTP responses with error details should use a `4XX` status code to indicate a client-side failure (such as invalid authorization, or an invalid parameter), and a `5XX` status code to indicate server-side failure (such as an uncaught exception).


### Pagination

If pagination is required to navigate datasets, use the method that makes the most sense for the API's data.

#### Parameters

Common patterns:

* `page` and `per_page`. Intuitive for many use cases. Links to "page 2" may not always contain the same data.
* `offset` and `limit`. This standard comes from the SQL database world, and is a good option when you need stable permalinks to result sets.
* `since` and `limit`. Get everything "since" some ID or timestamp. Useful when it's a priority to let clients efficiently stay "in sync" with data. Generally requires result set order to be very stable.

#### Metadata

Include enough metadata so that clients can calculate how much data there is, and how and whether to fetch the next set of results.

Example of how that might be implemented:

```json
{
  "results": [ ... actual results ... ],
  "pagination": {
    "count": 2340,
    "page": 4,
    "per_page": 20
  }
}
```

### Always use HTTPS

Any new API should use and require [HTTPS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) (using TLS/SSL). HTTPS provides:

* **Security**. The contents of the request are encrypted across the Internet.
* **Authenticity**. A stronger guarantee that a client is communicating with the real API.
* **Privacy**. Enhanced privacy for apps and users using the API. HTTP headers and query string parameters (among other things) will be encrypted.
* **Compatibility**. Broader client-side compatibility. For CORS requests to the API to work on HTTPS websites -- to not be blocked as mixed content -- those requests must be over HTTPS.

HTTPS should be configured using modern best practices, including ciphers that support [forward secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy), and [HTTP Strict Transport Security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security). **This is not exhaustive**: use tools like [SSL Labs](ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html) to evaluate an API's HTTPS configuration.

For an existing API that runs over plain HTTP, the first step is to add HTTPS support, and update the documentation to declare it the default, use it in examples, etc.

Then, evaluate the viability of disabling or redirecting plain HTTP requests. See [GSA/api.data.gov#34](https://github.com/GSA/api.data.gov/issues/34) for a discussion of some of the issues involved with transitioning from HTTP->HTTPS.

#### Server Name Indication

If you can, use [Server Name Indication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) (SNI) to serve HTTPS requests.

SNI is an extension to TLS, [first proposed in 2003](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3546), that allows SSL certificates for multiple domains to be served from a single IP address.

Using one IP address to host multiple HTTPS-enabled domains can significantly lower costs and complexity in server hosting and administration. This is especially true as IPv4 addresses become more rare and costly. SNI is a Good Idea, and it is widely supported.

However, some clients and networks still do not properly support SNI. As of this writing, that includes:

* Internet Explorer 8 and below on Windows XP
* Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and below.
* All versions of Python 2.x (a version of Python 2.x with SNI [is planned](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/)).
* Some enterprise network environments have been configured in some custom way that disables or interferes with SNI support. One identified network where this is the case: the White House.

When implementing SSL support for an API, evaluate whether SNI support makes sense for the audience it serves.

### Use UTF-8

Just [use UTF-8](http://utf8everywhere.org).

Expect accented characters or "smart quotes" in API output, even if they're not expected.

An API should tell clients to expect UTF-8 by including a charset notation in the `Content-Type` header for responses.

An API that returns JSON should use:

```
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

### CORS

For clients to be able to use an API from inside web browsers, the API must [enable CORS](http://enable-cors.org).

For the simplest and most common use case, where the entire API should be accessible from inside the browser, enabling CORS is as simple as including this HTTP header in all responses:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

It's supported by [every modern browser](http://enable-cors.org/client.html), and will Just Work in many JavaScript clients, like [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

For more advanced configuration, see the [W3C spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) or [Mozilla's guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS).

**What about JSONP?**

JSONP is [not secure or performant](https://gist.github.com/tmcw/6244497). If IE8 or IE9 must be supported, use Microsoft's [XDomainRequest](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx?Redirected=true) object instead of JSONP. There are [libraries](https://github.com/mapbox/corslite) to help with this.
